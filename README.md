# L2K_BurgerLogger

A restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat. The app maintains two lists, a wish list and a list of burgers consumed. The user is prevented from adding the same burger multiple times by an array which holds the contents of both lists. If a burger is on the wish list or has been consumed it cannot be added again. The user is given the capability to remove a burger which has been classified as consumed which will allow the burger to be added to the wish list once more.
